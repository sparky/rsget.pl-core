Experimental rsget.pl core. A shape of new things to come.

The goal is to adopt rsget.pl to server-like environment, possibly destroying
any compatibility with earlier versions.

Remarks:
- only daemon mode
- xmlrpc or similar communication method
- no integrated input/output interfaces
- store data in SQL database (will support at least SQlite3, PgSQL and MySQL)
- multi-user support

Salvaged clients:
- output-only terminal visualization
- input/output list file writer (with syntax similar to actual file list,
  or simpler one)
- input/output perl cgi application to create webbrowser interface

Clients planned in future:
- I/O ncurses client (something like rtorrent)
- I/O gtk client (try tu use code from slimrat)
- port cgi to php (for simplicity)
- port cgi to mod_perl (for speed)
