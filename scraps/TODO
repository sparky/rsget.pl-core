* Figure-out best directory structure:
  - core
  - code common for core and clients
  - clients
  - code common for multiple clients

  RSGet/Core
  RSGet/_Common
  RSGet/_CliCommon
  RSGet/Gtk
  RSGet/...

* FileWriter
  - find file
  - find best position to start
  - check whether it is worth to start if cannot continue
  - quickly check whether data written intersects with some old data
  - if new data doesn't match separate it from the file
