## it may be very slow to retrieve all vars recursively,
## better set them recursively instead

# additional information for file (like passwords)
[user]:core.list.file.[fileid].[varname] = TEXT

# additional information for file group (like passwords)
[user]:core.list.group.[groupid].[varname] = TEXT
